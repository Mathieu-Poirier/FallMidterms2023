\begin{enumerate}
    \item An experiment involves tossing a single die. These are some events:
    
    A: Observe a 2

    B: Observe an even number

    C: Observe a number greater than 2

    D: Observe both A and B

    E: Observe A or B or both

    F: Observe both A and C
    
\paragraph*{Questions} 

    
    
    \hfill \break a. List the simple events in the sample space

    b. List the simple events in each of the events A through F

    c. What probabilities should you assign to the simple events

    d. Calculate the probabilities of the six events by adding the appropriate simple-event probabilities
    
    \item A sample space S consists of five simple events with these probabilities:
    $$P(E_1) = P(E_2) = 0.15$$
    $$P(E_3) = 0.4$$
    $$P(E_4) = 2P(E_5)$$
    \paragraph*{Questions}
    
    \hfill \break a. Find the probability for the simple events $E_4$ and $E_5$
    
    b. Find the probabilities for these two events:
        $$A = (E_1, E_3, E_4)$$
        $$B = (E_2, E_3)$$
   
    c. List the simple events that are either in event A or event B or both

    d. List the simple events that are either in both event A and event B
    
    \item A sample space contains 10 simple events: $E_1, E_2,...,E_10$. If $P(E_1) = 3P(E_2) = 0.45$ and the remaining simple events are equiprobable, find the probabilities of these remaining simple events
