\begin{enumerate}
    \item An experiment involves tossing a single die. These are some events:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A: Observe a 2
    \item B: Observe an even number
    \item C: Observe a number greater than 2
    \item D: Observe both A and B
    \item E: Observe A or B or both
    \item F: Observe both A and C
    \end{itemize}
\paragraph*{Questions}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item a. List the simple events in the sample space
    \item b. List the simple events in each of the events A through F
    \item c. What probabilities should you assign to the simple events
    \item d. Calculate the probabilities of the six events by adding the appropriate simple-event probabilities
    \end{itemize}
    \item A sample space S consists of five simple events with these probabilities:
    $$P(E_1) = P(E_2) = 0.15$$
    $$P(E_3) = 0.4$$
    $$P(E_4) = 2P(E_5)$$
    \paragraph*{Questions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a. Find the probability for the simple events $E_4$ and $E_5$
        \item b. Find the probabilities for these two events:
        $$A = (E_1, E_3, E_4)$$
        $$B = (E_2, E_3)$$
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item c. List the simple events that are either in event A or event B or both
        \item d. List the simple events that are either in both event A and event B
    \end{itemize}
    \item A sample space contains 10 simple events: $E_1, E_2,...,E_10$. If $P(E_1) = 3P(E_2) = 0.45$ and the remaining simple events are equiprobable, find the probabilities of these remaining simple events
