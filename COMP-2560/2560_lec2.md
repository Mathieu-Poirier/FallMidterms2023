# Notes for Week 2

1. The core component of the OS is the kernel

2. What are the components of the kernel

## Files Manager

- Interacts with I/O devices
- I/O devices are represented as files or files-like objects "everything is a file"
- Interacts with device drivers by handling interrupts like IRQs
- dev/sda for your first hard drive
- Files are streams of 1's and 0's

## Memory Manager

- Handles memory allocation and deallocation 
- Virtual memory which allows processes to use more memory than is physically available by using a combination of RAM and disk space(page file or swap space)
- Paging involves divinding memory into fixed-size 'pages'
- Swapping involves moving data between RAM and disk

## Network Manager

- Not available in early versions of UNIX
- Communicates with a network through use of sockets
- Sockets allow processes on different devices to communicate with each other through a network

## Bootup

- Loading the kernel into memory from bootable memory is called bootup

## Main CPU Loop

1. Fetch the insturction pointer
2. Increment the instruction pointer
3. Excute whatever code is in the register
