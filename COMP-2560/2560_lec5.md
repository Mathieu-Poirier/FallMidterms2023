# Process vs Program

- Program: a file "dead body" in machine code that dosen't do anything unless it is in memory

- Process: a program in the memory ready to run and execute tasks

- The kernel makes  the program a process

### New BIOS Technologies like UEFI and GPT


## C program adventure

- code in editor->compile-link-execute

- compiling and linking can be done in one step

- cc program.c -o program

- ./program

## What is a Shell

- The shell is a simple program that allows you to interact with the computer 
- The process of the shell runs alongside the kernel but we can also ask things from the kernel directly
- The shells main process is busy waiting
- After completing a process the processor goes back to the shell for busy waiting. It knows the IP register of the shell, because the kernel attaches the shell IP to the end of the process memory cell
