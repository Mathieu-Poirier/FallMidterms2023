# Notes for Lecture 1

1. The von Neuman architecture is defined by

- The CPU is responsible to handling instructions and performing calculations

- Data and instructions are stored in memory

- The CPU operates on an instruction set stored in memory

- Instructions are executed sequentially unless specifically modified

- Programs and data are stored in memory

- Data transfer between computers can be done through I/O devices

2. CISC vs RISC

- CISC architectures have a large and complex instruction set, often with a wide variety of instructions that can perform complex operations in a single instruction. These instructions can be quite detailed and may include addressing modes that facilitate memory operations.
