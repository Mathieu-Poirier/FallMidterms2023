# Notes for Week 1

1. The von Neuman architecture is defined by

- The CPU is responsible to handling instructions and performing calculations

- Data and instructions are stored in memory

- The CPU operates on an instruction set stored in memory

- Instructions are executed sequentially unless specifically modified

- Programs and data are stored in memory

- Data transfer between computers can be done through I/O devices

2. CISC vs RISC

- CISC architectures have a large and complex instruction set, often with a wide variety of instructions that can perform complex operations in a single instruction. These instructions can be quite detailed and may include addressing modes that facilitate memory operations.

- RISC: RISC processors have a simplified and reduced instruction set, typically consisting of a smaller number of instructions. Each instruction in RISC is designed to perform a single, specific task, which makes the instruction set more straightforward.

3. Opcode, Assembly and C code

- Opcode is not very human readable and can be very lengthy in size, yet very efficient

- Assembly has fair readability compared to opcode but is slightly less efficient than opcode because of a lookup table that the CPU has to process

- C code however is very human readable and the most conscice to program with, yet has two layers of abstraction to opcode

- Opcode changes (CPU architecture), we would need a new assembler

- Language changes we would need a new compiler
