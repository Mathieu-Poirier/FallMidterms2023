# Why not give the adress of the kernel to the BIOS?

## Explanation

- Abstraction: The BIOS is designed to be hardware angnostic and allow Operating Systems to be portable on any hardware
- Security: Revealing exact locations of the kernel in memory makes it more exploitable by malicious software
- Flexibility: Since the BIOS is a firmware component of the computer architecture, it should have direct access to the kernel adress since different operating systems use different memory layouts and one system can have multiple defferent kernels

## Who Sets the IRQ Table

- Keystroke -> CPU -> IRQ -> IRQ Handler
- The kernel sets the IRQ table but there is a standard IRQ adress for different devices
- Instead of every key sending a different IRQ signal, it sends information alonside the IRQ signal and let's the handler decode deal with different singals
