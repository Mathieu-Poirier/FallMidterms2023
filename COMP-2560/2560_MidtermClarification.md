# Midterm clarification

- The journey of a keystroke from when you press a key on your keyboard to the point where it triggers an interrupt request (IRQ) and is eventually processed by the operating system involves several steps. Here's a simplified overview of the process:

- Key Press: When you press a key on your keyboard, an electrical circuit within the keyboard is completed, which generates an electrical signal corresponding to the key that was pressed.

- Keyboard Controller: The electrical signal from the keypress is sent to the keyboard controller. The keyboard controller is a microcontroller embedded in the keyboard, and it processes the keypress signal.

- Scan Code Generation: The keyboard controller translates the keypress into a scan code, which is a unique code assigned to each key on the keyboard. This scan code is used to identify which key was pressed.

- IRQ Line: The keyboard controller communicates with the computer's CPU through an interrupt request (IRQ) line. The keyboard is typically assigned a specific IRQ line (e.g., IRQ 1) for this purpose.

- Interrupt Request: When a key is pressed and the scan code is generated, the keyboard controller sends an interrupt request to the CPU by asserting the assigned IRQ line. This signals the CPU that a keyboard-related event has occurred and needs to be processed.

- IRQ Handler: The CPU, upon receiving the interrupt request, invokes the appropriate IRQ handler for the keyboard. The IRQ handler is a part of the operating system's kernel and is responsible for processing keyboard input.

- Input Processing: The IRQ handler reads the scan code generated by the keyboard controller and converts it into a more recognizable form, such as an ASCII character or a virtual key code. This processed input is then passed to the appropriate application or service.

- User Interaction: The application or service that receives the keyboard input can now react to the keypress, updating the user interface or performing the desired action.

- It's important to note that this is a simplified overview, and the actual process may vary depending on the hardware and operating system in use. Additionally, modern keyboards may use USB or other protocols, which have slightly different mechanisms, but the fundamental concept of using interrupts and scan codes to handle keyboard input remains similar.
