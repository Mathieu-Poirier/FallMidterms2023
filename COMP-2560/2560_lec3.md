# What Happens During Bootup?

## Pre-Bios

- Since there was no voltage, the first adress the CPU points to is 0
- It starts busy waiting by incrementing the instruction pointer and jumping back to the first address

## BIOS (Basic I/O Systerm)

- The BIOS os embedded in a chip made by the manufacturer (usually on the motherboard)
- BIOS loads the MBR into memory and the BIOS knows the location of the MBR so it gives the its pointer to the CPU

## MBR

- MBR (Master Boot Record) Knows where to find the operating system in memory
- MBRs are always in the first position on the disk (sector 0 or LBA)

## Modifying the MBR

- You can modify the MBR to allow a user to double boot OSs

## Kernel

- Once the kernel is running, all programs/processes communicate to the machine via the kernel

## The Adventure of a Keystroke

- The electrical pulse from the keystroke goes to the processor (put simply)
- The processor send a signal to the device manager (keyboard controller)
- The (Interrupt Request Handled) IRQ knows where the device manager is in memory
- Keyboard controller send an interrupt signal to the CPU, this halts the activity of the CPU temporarily to focus on the keystroke
- ISR processes the keystroke scan code and places it into an input buffer
- Operating system checks the input buffers, this scancode will be mapped to a key on your keyboard and the system will convert the related key to ASCII or Unicode which can trigger an action on an application
