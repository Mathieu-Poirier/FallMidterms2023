# Building a static library

- Make all of your functions in separate .o (object files)

- Collect them all into a .zip file (convention for libraries are .a)

- When writing a program using library functions, make sure to include the function prototypes in a header file with all the prototypes

## Shell

- ls program is commonly used, so it is statically linked to the shell for speed

- These are the shell built-ins that are statically linked

## POSIX Compliant?

- Standard interfaces
- Standard shell commands
- Standard files structure including /bin /usr /etc
- Standard environment variables
- Standard regex functions
- Supports shell scripting
