# App Level System Call and Library Routines

## System Call

- An app level call/request from the kernel

- The kernel can reject a system call unlike an IRQ

## Library Routines

- Library routines are extra code written by the kernel developers for you to use in your programs (simply link it into your code)

- Library routines can be linked statically or dynamically

### Statically

- Loads the library into memory at the start of the process

### Dynamically

- Loads the necessary library routines at runtime, when needed

## Which to Use?

- Statically takes up more memory but is faster

- Dynamically takes less memory but is slower

- It's ultimately up to you which are essential libraries and which are used more rarely
